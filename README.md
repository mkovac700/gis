# GIS project

This is a GIS project I did with my team as a part of the Geographic Information Systems course @ FOI back in 2021.

We used a Sparkfun board to connect the RHT03 sensor and the Sigfox module. The RHT03 sensor collected temperature and humidity data, which we sent via the Sigfox Wisol module over the network. Then we used the Sigfox control panel to write a callback function to send the retrieved data to our e-mail addresses.
